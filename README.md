# 8-Bit-Barrel-Shifter
8 Bit Barrel Shifter Verilog Code
The Barrel shifter, unlike regular shifters, is a combinational circuit rather than a sequential circuit. While register-based shifters require 8 clock cycles to shift an 8-bit data, the Barrel Shifter accomplishes the same task in just one clock cycle. Due to this efficiency, it finds application in ALUs for performing shifting operations.
